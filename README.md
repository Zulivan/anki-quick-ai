# Usage

## Anki Add-On (Developing)

### Setup

[add-on/lib] contains third-party libraries that are not supported by Anki. Currently, Anki add-ons require third-party libraries to be bundled with the source code.

(Optionally) Update third-party libraries:
```bash
cd add-on
pip install -r requirements.txt --target lib
```


### Usage

Click the `Tools` button on the menu bar in the main Anki window, and then click `AI Words Story`. Wait for seconds for AI generation and transmission between OpenAI and your local machine. If you also generate the sound, then it may take another seconds for sound generation.


## Local Usage

### Setup

1. The program is connected with Anki through [Anki-Connect](https://github.com/FooSoft/anki-connect). First, install Anki-Connect add-on for your Anki.

2. Install requirements:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Edit environment variables in `./src/.env`:

   1. Copy the example file:

        ```
        cp .env_example .env
        ```
    
    2. Input your settings. Delete all empty variables, which will be replaced with default values in the `src/configure.py`.

4. (Advanced) Customize words: specify `query` in `src/.env`. The query grammar is the same as Anki browse, which can be found in the (manual)(https://docs.ankiweb.net/searching.html).

### Usage

1. Run the program. Make sure Anki is running for Anki-Connection:

    ```
    python src/gpt.py
    ```

2. The information is generated in the terminal, and the sound generated by [edge-tts](https://github.com/rany2/edge-tts) is automatically played. In addition, two .mp3 files are generated. `output/article.mp3` is the audio file for the original article. `output/translated_article.mp3` is the audio file for the translation.
